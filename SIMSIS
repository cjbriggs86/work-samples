#work-samples/SIMSIS
## Simulated Student Information System (SIS)
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my data wrangling skills. It includes the structure and randomly generated content of a fictitious SIS. The general file structure is loosely based on my real-world experience, but in no way represents nor copies data from real-world companies.

## Table of Contents & Summaries [WIP - 10/28/2025]
### Python files used to generate the associated data:
generate_admins.py
generate_assignments.py
generate_assistivetechs.py
generate_contacts.py
generate_ieps.py
generate_programs.py
generate_relatedservices.py
generate_reportcards.py
generate_studentdata_witherrors.py

### Data files within this project:
administrators.txt - output of Python code used to generate service providers to relate to IEPs

contactdemographics.txt - output of Python code used to generate fictitious student family members to relate to students

iepassistivetechdevices.txt

iepdocuments.txt

iepprograms.txt

ieprelatedservices.txt

studentassignments.txt

studentdata_witherrors.txt - output of the Python file, imported to SSMS for wrangling and relation to the other files, as well as Excel for visualization exercises

studentdemographics.txt - table housing cleaned student data and relation to the other sections
