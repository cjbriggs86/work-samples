## Data Project Tracking

The purpose of this hub is to build a portfolio of my work to demonstrate my skills as a Data Analyst and Technical Writer. This document tracks and introduces the projects contained within the overall hub.

1. Data wrangling and cleanup
- I used GenAI and Python to create randomized sample datasets that would populate a fictitious school district’s Student Information System (SIS) including special education and IEP data.
- The scripts included a random chance to skip fields when creating records, creating an opportunity for me to practice identifying, replacing, and/or updating them in Excel and SQL.
- While I used my real-world experience to design this project, none of it is real data and any and all references to real people (myself included) are fictional or coincidental.

2. Financial analysis
- I had an opportunity to help someone monitor her spending habits and report back ways she could decrease spending in order to improve savings.
- As these transactions were exported from a bank, there (fortunately) was no opportunity for data wrangling. Instead, my work focused on grouping, totaling, and ranking them to identify trends that would lead to recommendations.
- While PII was never included to begin with, I still obfuscated or removed details from some of the specific purchases.
- This data is of course used with the client’s express permission.

3. Time analysis
- I had an opportunity to help someone monitor her time allotments at work and report back which projects were consuming her time to identify ways to increase her own efficiency.
- As these records were exported from her time tracking system, there (fortunately) was no opportunity for data wrangling. I was, however, able to identify data entry trends that helped her improve the integrity of her entries. Again, my work focused on grouping, totaling, and ranking them to identify trends that would lead to recommendations.
- I obfuscated the project names as they directly referred to her clients and removed PII while retaining the individuality of each record.
- This data is of course used with the client’s express permission.
